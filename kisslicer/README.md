Notes on kisslicer configurations

1. Note, these configurations are mostly tuned to *my bot* so please treat them as a reference
1. Most of the material settings are at least temperature tuned for *my bot* ;)

I cannot recommend kisslicer [tuning wizards](http://www.kisslicer.com/tuning-wizard-files.html) enough ;) Also check out the corresponding videos from [sublime layers](http://www.sublimelayers.com/) blog postings and the [videos](http://www.sublimelayers.com/2017/10/slicer-blog-posts-and-youtube-videos.html) Michael puts together - amazingly helpful.
